## 6. Sub-Agent System

### 6.1 Command Construction

The bridge constructs a `claude -p` command from `spawn_agent` parameters. Here is the exact mapping:

```
claude
  --print                                    # Always: non-interactive pipe mode
  --output-format text                       # Always: plain text output (not JSON)
  --system-prompt "<preamble + system_prompt>" # Always: full system prompt replacement
  [--model <model>]                          # If model parameter provided
  [--add-dir <memory_dir>]                   # If allow_memory_read is true
  [--add-dir <dir1>] [--add-dir <dir2>] ... # For each additional_dirs entry
```

The `task` string is piped to the subprocess's stdin.

**Working directory:** Set via `proc.Dir` in Go's `exec.Cmd`. This also activates Claude Code's directory sandbox — the sub-agent cannot access files outside this directory (or explicitly granted `--add-dir` directories).

### 6.2 Default System Preamble

This preamble is injected into every sub-agent invocation. Because `--system-prompt` replaces Claude Code's entire default behavioral prompt (empirically confirmed), this is the sole set of behavioral instructions the sub-agent receives.

```
You are a sub-agent performing a focused task on behalf of a primary Claude conversation.

Rules:
- Complete the assigned task and return your findings as text output.
- Be concise and structured. Prefer markdown formatting for readability.
- Keep your response under 2,000 words unless the task requires more detail. Your output
  will be truncated if it exceeds a token budget, so prioritize the most important findings.
- Do NOT modify files under C:\franl\.claude-agent-memory\. This directory is read-only for you.
- Do NOT commit to Git or push to any remote repository unless the task explicitly asks for it.
- If you cannot complete the task with the information provided, return a clear explanation
  of what additional information or context you need.
- Do NOT engage in open-ended exploration. Stay focused on the assigned task.
```

### 6.3 System Prompt Assembly

The final system prompt passed to `--system-prompt` is assembled as:

```
[DEFAULT_PREAMBLE]

[caller's system_prompt, if provided]
```

Example: If the primary agent calls `spawn_agent` with `system_prompt: "Return your analysis as a markdown list. Each finding should have a severity (high/medium/low)."`, the sub-agent receives:

```
You are a sub-agent performing a focused task on behalf of a primary Claude conversation.

Rules:
- Complete the assigned task and return your findings as text output.
- Be concise and structured. Prefer markdown formatting for readability.
- [... rest of default preamble ...]

Return your analysis as a markdown list. Each finding should have a severity (high/medium/low).
```

### 6.4 Directory Sandbox Behavior

Claude Code's directory sandbox is enforcement-level security provided by Claude Code's own infrastructure:

| Scenario | `working_directory` | `allow_memory_read` | `additional_dirs` | Sub-agent can access |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Minimal | `C:\franl\projects\foo` | false | none | Only `C:\franl\projects\foo\**` |
| With memory | `C:\franl\projects\foo` | true | none | `C:\franl\projects\foo\**` + `C:\franl\.claude-agent-memory\**` (read) |
| Multi-repo | `C:\franl\projects\foo` | false | `[C:\franl\projects\bar]` | `C:\franl\projects\foo\**` + `C:\franl\projects\bar7**` |
| Memory + multi-repo | `C:\franl\projects\foo` | true | `[C:\franl\projects\bar]` | All three directories |

**Important:** The sandbox blocks reads, not just writes. If `allow_memory_read` is `false`, the sub-agent cannot even `cat` a memory file — Claude Code will refuse the operation.

**Write protection for memory files** is preamble-based (compliance), not enforced by the sandbox. If `allow_memory_read` is `true`, the sub-agent could technically write to the memory directory. The preamble instructs against this. For additional hardening, the bridge could launch the subprocess with the memory directory mounted read-only at the OS level (platform-specific).

### 6.5 CLAUDE.md Recommendations

The file `C:\Users\flitt\.claude\CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every Claude Code invocation automatically (including sub-agents), independent of `--system-prompt`. It should be optimized for the sub-agent use case:

**Target size:** Under 500 tokens (~400 words).

**Should include:**
- OS environment (Windows 11 + Cygwin, shell behavior, pathname conventions)
- Available tools (compilers, package managers, utilities)
- Source code conventions (line width, comments, encoding, newlines)
- Memory bootstrap — the mandatory `memory_start_conversation` call at conversation start
  (see the sub-agent-safety note below). This is session-core behavior, not a service-specific
  instruction, so it is not excluded by the "should NOT include" rule that follows.

**Should NOT include:**
- Credentials (API tokens, passwords — use environment variables instead)
- Interactive instructions ("confirm with the user")
- Service-specific instructions (Bluesky conventions, GitHub profile)
- Niche build instructions (GUI flags, specific project configs)

Recommended `CLAUDE.md` content:

```markdown
# OS Environment

- This is a Windows 11 system with Cygwin installed.
- Bash commands are executed by the Cygwin Bash shell.
- Most Linux commands are available: cd, cat, ls, grep, find, cp, mv, sed, awk, git, python, etc.
- To execute `rm`, use the full pathname `/bin/rm` (avoids a wrapper script's confirmation prompt).
- Cygwin symlinks for drive letters exist: /c -> /cygdrive/c, /d -> /cygdrive/d, etc.
  Native Windows apps cannot follow Cygwin symlinks.

## Pathname Conventions

- Cygwin apps: use forward slashes. Absolute paths start with /c/ (drive letter).
  Example: /c/franl/git/project/file.txt
- Native Windows apps: use backslashes, single-quoted to escape.
  Example: 'C:\franl\git\project\file.txt'
- If a pathname contains spaces or shell metacharacters, always single-quote it.

## Available Tools

- Compilers/runtimes: gcc, g++, go, rustc, cargo, python, node, npm, npx.
- Package managers: uv, uvx (Python), npm/npx (Node.js).
- Utilities: git, gh (GitHub CLI).
- Do not install additional tools without explicit task instructions to do so.

# Source Code Conventions

- Line width: under 100 columns.
- Use meaningful variable/loop names (not single characters).
- Newlines: UNIX-style (LF) for new files. Match existing convention when editing.
- Encoding: UTF-8 for new files. Match existing encoding when editing.
- Comments: write well-commented code. Aim for nearly as many comment lines as code lines.
  Comments should explain purpose and rationale, not restate what the code does.
  Place comments on the line above the code they reference.
- Prefer Python and Bash for scripts. Use PEP 723 metadata in Python scripts.
- Bash variables: UPPERCASE for globals, _UPPERCASE for function locals.
- When building executables, always use .exe extension (Windows).

# Memory Bootstrap

- If the memory tools (memory_start_conversation and the other memory_* tools) are
  available in this session, call memory_start_conversation ONCE, before any other
  action, at the very start of the conversation. It returns a handle together with the
  current core memory and the block index; pass that handle to every later memory tool
  call. This is the only way to obtain a handle.
- If a memory tool reports an unknown or invalid handle, call memory_start_conversation
  again to get a fresh handle and retry.
- If the memory tools are NOT available in this session, this instruction does not apply;
  do nothing for it.
```

**Sub-agent safety of the memory-bootstrap block.** The `CLAUDE.md` above is loaded into *every*
Claude Code invocation, including sub-agents, and sub-agents do not inherit the parent session's MCP
connections ([Section 7.8](stateful-agent-design-chapter7.md#78-claude-code-deployment)) — so a
sub-agent has no memory tools. The block is therefore written as a **conditional guarded on tool
availability**: the primary agent, which has the memory tools, acts on it; a sub-agent, which does
not, treats it as inert. Without that guard the instruction would tell every sub-agent to call a
tool it cannot reach, producing a guaranteed failed call at the top of every sub-agent run. The
guard is the reason the directive is phrased "if the memory tools are available" rather than as a
bare imperative. This is consistent with [Section 6.6](#66-sub-agent-memory-access-rules): sub-agents
receive no Layer 2 write access, and here they correctly receive no bootstrap obligation either.

The token cost of the block is small (well under 100 tokens), so it does not threaten the target
size above. The rationale for placing it here at all — rather than relying on the skill description —
is given in [Chapter 5, Section 5.8](stateful-agent-design-chapter5.md#58-bootstrapping-via-an-unconditionally-loaded-channel).

### 6.6 Sub-Agent Memory Access Rules

| Layer | Access | Enforcement | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Layer 1 (Anthropic built-in) | None | Platform | `claude -p` does not receive built-in memory. Platform limitation. |
| Layer 2 (supplementary) | Read-only (optional) | Sandbox (read) + preamble (write) | Controlled by `allow_memory_read`. Default: false. |
| CLAUDE.md | Auto-loaded | None (automatic) | Loaded by Claude Code startup, cannot be suppressed. Keep credentials out. |

**Why no write access?** Allowing sub-agents to write to Layer 2 would break the single-writer model and reintroduce concurrent write problems. The primary agent is the sole writer. Sub-agents return findings in their text response; the primary agent decides what to persist.

**Maintenance merge sub-agents.** During `memory_run_maintenance` (see [Chapter 3, Section 3.13](stateful-agent-design-chapter3.md#313-tool-memory_run_maintenance)), the bridge spawns sub-agents to perform semantic merges of branched blocks. These are *bridge-internal* invocations: the merge sub-agent receives the base and branch content as input and returns the merged text in its response, like any other sub-agent. The sub-agent never writes to the memory directory — the **bridge itself** writes the merged result to the base block (under the write mutex, via atomic temp-file + rename). The single-writer model is therefore preserved: from the filesystem's perspective, the bridge process remains the only writer of memory files.
