## 7. Build and Deployment

### 7.1 Build the Bridge

```bash
# Clone the repo
cd C:\franl\git
git clone https://github.com/fpl9000/mcp-bridge

# Build (produces single static binary)
cd mcp-bridge
go build -o mcp-bridge.exe .

# Verify
./mcp-bridge.exe --version
```

No CGO, no external dependencies. The binary is self-contained.

Install the bridge with these Bash commands:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.claude-agent-memory/bin
$ cp mcp-bridge.exe ~/.claude-agent-memory/bin
```

### 7.2 Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit Claude Desktop's MCP configuration file:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **MacOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (no official support for Claude Desktop on Linux)

Add the bridge server entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-bridge": {
      "command": "C:\\franl\\.claude-agent-memory\\bin\\mcp-bridge\\mcp-bridge.exe",
      "args": ["--config", "C:\\franl\\.claude-agent-memory\\bridge-config.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Desktop App will launch the bridge as a subprocess on startup, communicating via stdio.

**Note:** The Filesystem extension does **not** appear in `claude_desktop_config.json` and should **not** be added there. It is a first-party Claude Desktop extension developed by Anthropic and distributed through Claude Desktop's built-in extensions gallery (Settings > Extensions). It is installed, enabled, and configured entirely through the Claude Desktop UI — not via the config JSON file. Claude Desktop manages its configuration for first-party extensions through a separate internal store. See the resolution of Open Question #6 for details.

### 7.3 Filesystem Extension Configuration

The Filesystem extension is enabled and configured via Claude Desktop's Extensions UI (Settings > Extensions > Filesystem > Configure). The allowed directories (e.g., `C:\franl`, `C:\temp`, `C:\apps`) are set there, not in `claude_desktop_config.json`.

The memory directory (`C:\franl\.claude-agent-memory`) is covered because it is a subdirectory of `C:\franl`, which is already an allowed directory. No additional configuration is needed.

### 7.4 Memory Directory Setup

Create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p C:/franl/.claude-agent-memory/blocks
```

Create the bridge configuration file (`bridge-config.yaml`) with the schema defined in [Section 3.2](stateful-agent-design-chapter3.md#32-configuration).

### 7.5 Initial Memory Seeding

The first time the memory system is used, Claude will find an empty memory store: `memory_start_conversation` returns empty `core` content and an empty derived index. The skill instructions handle this: "If the core content is empty, this is a first-run scenario."

However, it's better to pre-seed the memory with initial content derived from existing knowledge. This avoids a cold-start problem where Claude's first session has no Layer 2 context.

**Seeding approach:**

1. Manually create `core.md` with basic identity and project information (copy from Layer 1 memory or from conversation history). Note that `core.md` has no YAML frontmatter — it is not an indexed block.
2. Optionally create initial project blocks in `blocks\`. If creating blocks by hand, include the bridge's YAML frontmatter (`summary` and `updated_at` fields) so they appear correctly in the derived index — or simpler, let Claude create them via `memory_write_block`, which generates the frontmatter automatically.
3. The episodic log will be created automatically on the first `memory_append_episodic` call.

There is no index file to create: the index is derived on demand from block frontmatter (see [Chapter 4, Section 4.4](stateful-agent-design-chapter4.md#44-the-derived-index)).

Alternatively, ask Claude in an initial conversation to seed the memory from its Layer 1 knowledge: "Please seed the memory system's core and initial blocks using what you know about me from your built-in memory." Claude will use `memory_write_core` and `memory_write_block`, and the index follows automatically.

### 7.6 Skill Installation

1. Create the `SKILL.md` file with the content from [Section 5.2](stateful-agent-design-chapter5.md#52-skillmd-content).
2. Create a .zip file containing only `SKILL.md`:
   ```bash
   zip stateful-memory.zip SKILL.md
   ```
3. Upload via Claude Desktop > Settings > Capabilities > Add Skill.

### 7.7 CLAUDE.md Update

Replace the current `C:\Users\flitt\.claude\CLAUDE.md` with the lean sub-agent-optimized version described in [Section 6.5](stateful-agent-design-chapter6.md#65-claudemd-recommendations) and the proposal. Move credentials to environment variables. Move service-specific instructions to `spawn_agent` system_prompt parameters.
