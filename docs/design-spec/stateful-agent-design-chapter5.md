## 5. Memory Skill

The memory-aware tool redesign makes this the most-simplified chapter of the design. The v1 skill had to teach Claude the storage model: file paths, session IDs, branch annotations, index maintenance, race recovery, and a list of forbidden tools. All of that is now enforced by the bridge in code. What remains for the skill is the part that genuinely requires judgment: **when** to read and write memory, **what** to store, and **how** to structure it. The skill teaches lifecycle and content quality; the bridge guarantees storage correctness.

### 5.1 Skill Packaging

The memory skill is installed in one of two ways, depending on the client ([Chapter 7](stateful-agent-design-chapter7.md#7-build-and-deployment)). Claude Code reads skills directly from the filesystem, so installation there is a file copy and the packaging rules below do not apply. Claude Desktop takes an uploaded archive, described here.

The memory skill is a Claude Desktop skill packaged as a `.zip` file. Claude Desktop's uploader expects the archive to contain a single top-level *folder* whose name matches the skill's `name`, with `SKILL.md` inside it — not a bare `SKILL.md` at the archive root (a mismatched or missing folder is a documented upload-failure cause). The skill contains no scripts (all operations use the bridge's MCP tools). Upload it via Claude Desktop > Customize > Skills > "+" > "Upload a skill". Keep the `.zip` extension; `.skill` is only the extension Claude Desktop produces when you *download* an existing skill.

```
stateful-memory.zip
└── stateful-memory/       # Folder name matches the skill's `name` (SKILL.md frontmatter)
    └── SKILL.md           # Instructions for Layer 2 memory lifecycle
```

**Why no scripts?** All memory operations are performed via the bridge's memory-aware MCP tools. No Python or shell scripts are needed. This eliminates dependency management and makes the skill trivially portable.

### 5.2 SKILL.md Content

**The skill file is not reproduced here. Its single source of truth is [`skill/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/fpl9000/mcp-bridge/blob/main/skill/SKILL.md) in the `fpl9000/mcp-bridge` repository** (note that repository is private, so the link resolves only for its owner).

Earlier revisions of this section carried a complete copy of the file. That arrangement put the same artifact under version control in two repositories, with no mechanism keeping them equal, and the two had in fact already diverged in both directions: the copy here was a superset in one place (it retained the maintenance instructions preserved below) and stale in another (it predated changes made directly to the shipped file). Prose about the skill belongs in a design document; the skill itself is a build input, it is packaged by `build-release.sh`, and it is versioned alongside the bridge whose tools it describes. It lives there.

What this section still owns is the *design intent* the file has to satisfy. Three constraints are normative and are stated elsewhere in this document rather than in the file itself:

- **Packaging** — [Section 5.1](#51-skill-packaging) governs the archive layout and the installation path for each client.
- **Frontmatter** — [Section 5.7](#57-frontmatter-constraints-and-portability) governs the `name` and `description` fields, including the 200-character budget on `description` and the reasoning behind it.
- **Bootstrapping** — [Section 5.8](#58-bootstrapping-via-an-unconditionally-loaded-channel) governs how the skill comes to be invoked at the start of a conversation in the first place.

In outline, the file covers the memory model (core, blocks, the derived index, the episodic log), conversation handles and their recovery, the conversation-start protocol, read and write triggers during a conversation, block-creation rules, memory-quality guidelines, error handling, and end-of-conversation behavior. Sections 5.3 through 5.6 below give the design rationale for each of those; the file is the operative statement of them.

#### Deferred content

A shipped `SKILL.md` must never instruct Claude to call a tool that its build does not register — an instruction to invoke a nonexistent tool is worse than a missing instruction, because the model will attempt the call. The minimal Layer 2 build registers eight tools and defers `memory_run_maintenance`, along with the sub-agent machinery its semantic merge requires, so the file correctly says nothing about maintenance today.

The following text is held here, outside the file, and is to be added to it when `memory_run_maintenance` is implemented — not before. It is recorded in this document precisely because it must *not* live in the shipped file yet, which makes this the one part of the skill's content that the design spec still holds directly.

A `## Memory Maintenance` section, placed between `### Memory quality guidelines` and `## Error Handling`:

```markdown
## Memory Maintenance

If the user asks you to run memory maintenance, merge memory, consolidate memory,
or similar: call `memory_run_maintenance(handle)`. This consolidates memory that
has accumulated from concurrent conversations back into a single canonical state.
The call may take a noticeable amount of time, and memory operations in other
concurrent conversations will briefly block while it runs — that's expected, and
acceptable because the user asked for it. If the response has `more_pending: true`,
call it again to continue until `more_pending` is false, then report the total
number of merged blocks to the user.
```

And a bullet added to the `## Error Handling` list:

```markdown
- `MAINTENANCE_IN_PROGRESS` → memory is being consolidated; retry shortly.
```

When comparing a deployed `SKILL.md` against the repository copy, check the build's registered tool list before treating a difference as drift.

### 5.3 Conversation Lifecycle

Detailed sequence of operations at each phase:

```
Conversation Start
│
├─ 1. Skill instructions loaded into context (automatic, ~400 tokens)
├─ 2. Layer 1 memory loaded into context (automatic, ~500–2,000 tokens)
├─ 3. Call memory_start_conversation → receive handle (echoed on every later
│       call), core (~500–1,000 tokens), and the derived index (~300–800 tokens)
├─ 4. Evaluate user's first message against index entries
├─ 5. memory_get_block(handle, name) for any relevant blocks (varies)
└─ 6. Respond to user's first message
│
Conversation Active
│
├─ On topic change → check index, load relevant blocks (memory_get_block)
├─ On significant information → update the relevant block or core
│     (memory_write_block / memory_write_core)
├─ On new project/topic → create a new block (memory_write_block with summary)
├─ On decision made → update the decisions block or project block
├─ Periodically / at breakpoints → append episodic entry (memory_append_episodic)
├─ On changed_since_last_read: true → re-validate conclusions drawn from the
│     earlier version of that content
└─ On any handle error → memory_start_conversation, retry
│
Conversation End (if detectable)
│
├─ 1. Write pending updates (memory_write_core / memory_write_block)
├─ 2. Append an episodic entry summarizing the conversation (memory_append_episodic)
└─ 3. (No announcement needed — just persist silently)
```

Note what is *absent* from this lifecycle relative to v1: no session-ID storage discipline (the handle is refreshed in context by every tool response), no index-row maintenance (the index is derived), no branch handling (branches are invisible), and no list of forbidden tools (there are no file paths for the LLM to misuse — the Filesystem extension and cloud VM tools simply have no role in memory access).

### 5.4 Memory Write Triggers

The skill should write memory when these conditions are met:

| Trigger | What to write | Tool |
|---------|---------------|------|
| New project started | Project name, initial description, goals | `memory_write_block` (new `project-<name>`, summary required) + core update |
| Significant decision made | Decision, rationale, date | `memory_write_block` or `memory_append_block` on `decisions` or the project block |
| Project status change | New status, what changed | `memory_write_core` (summary) + `memory_write_block` (detail) |
| User shares key fact | The fact, context | `memory_write_core` (if high-level) or relevant block |
| Technical pattern discovered | The pattern, when to use it | `memory_write_block` on `reference-<topic>` |
| Conversation in progress (periodic) | Brief summary of what's happened so far | `memory_append_episodic` |
| Conversation ending | Conversation summary | `memory_append_episodic` |

### 5.5 Memory Read Triggers

| Trigger | What to read | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Conversation start (always) | Core, then the index | Establish identity and awareness of available context |
| User mentions a project | The project's block | Load detailed context for informed responses |
| User asks "what do you remember" | Relevant blocks based on the topic and index summaries | Provide comprehensive recall |
| User references a past decision | The `decisions` block or relevant project block | Provide accurate rationale |
| Planning future work | Relevant project blocks + `decisions` | Inform planning with historical context |
| `changed_since_last_read: true` received | Related blocks, if conclusions depended on them | Re-validate stale reasoning |

There is no full-text search over memory in v1. Retrieval is index-driven: the index summaries are the search surface, which is why the skill emphasizes writing summaries that support future load decisions. A dedicated `memory_search` tool is a future enhancement (see [Chapter 9, Section 9.1](stateful-agent-design-chapter9.md#91-fts5-search-index-option-3) and [Chapter 11, OQ#16](stateful-agent-design-chapter11.md)).

### 5.6 Reconciliation with Layer 1

Periodically (monthly, or when the user requests it), the primary agent should reconcile Layer 1 and Layer 2:

**Step 1:** Spawn a sub-agent with `allow_memory_read: true` to read all Layer 2 files and produce a structured digest:
```
spawn_agent(
  task: "Read all files in C:\franl\.claude-agent-memory\ and produce a structured 
         digest listing: active projects, completed projects, key facts,
         recent decisions, and any stale or contradictory content. Ignore
         .bridge-state.json, bridge-config.yaml, bridge.log, and any *.branch-* files.",
  allow_memory_read: true,
  model: "sonnet"  // Routine analysis task
)
```

(The sub-agent reads files directly — read-only, via its sandbox — so it sees the on-disk layout including frontmatter. That is fine: the memory-concepts abstraction exists for the *primary* agent's tool surface; a digest task is explicitly about inspecting the store. Branch files are excluded from the digest because their content is pending consolidation.)

**Step 2:** The primary agent (which has Layer 1 in context automatically) compares both layers and identifies:
- **Gaps:** Important Layer 2 facts that Layer 1 should summarize
- **Contradictions:** Layer 1 says a project is active, Layer 2 says it's completed
- **Stale entries:** Layer 1 references outdated information

**Step 3:** The primary agent applies fixes:
- **Layer 1 fixes:** Add steering edits via the `memory_user_edits` tool. These are incorporated by Anthropic's nightly regeneration (~24-hour lag).
- **Layer 2 fixes:** Update memory via `memory_write_core` / `memory_write_block` (immediate effect).

### 5.7 Frontmatter Constraints and Portability

The `description` field is subject to **three different documented limits**, depending on how the skill reaches the agent. Getting this wrong is a silent failure, so the constraints are recorded here rather than left to be rediscovered.

| Surface | `name` | `description` | Nature of the limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent Skills specification / Claude API skill upload | 64 chars | **1024 chars** | Hard validation; the Create Skill endpoint rejects a bundle that exceeds it |
| Claude.ai skill upload (including Claude Desktop, which is a Claude.ai client) | 64 chars | **200 chars** | Documented product limit, tighter than the specification |
| Claude Code (filesystem-installed skills) | 64 chars | No separate documented cap beyond the specification's 1024 | Subject instead to a context budget across the whole skill listing, which can drop or truncate descriptions when many skills are installed |

**Design decision: the `description` targets 200 characters or fewer.**

The reasoning is that 200 is the tightest documented ceiling among the surfaces this system may plausibly be delivered through, and a description authored to the 1024-character specification limit cannot be uploaded through the Claude.ai Skills UI without being edited first. Since the Stateful Agent system may eventually be packaged for general release rather than remaining a personal deployment, the skill must install unmodified on every surface. Designing to the tightest ceiling costs a little expressiveness once; designing to the loosest costs a manual edit on every constrained install, forever.

**On enforcement.** In July 2026 the 570-character `description` this design previously specified was observed reaching a Claude.ai session's skill listing fully intact, so the 200-character limit is evidently not enforced uniformly on every upload path today. That observation is deliberately *not* treated as license to exceed it. Non-enforcement is not a contract: it can be tightened at any time, and — see below — the failure it would produce is invisible.

**Why truncation is the dangerous failure mode.** A description that exceeds a limit is not rejected with an error the author will notice; it is silently cut, from the end. The trailing content of a description is where "and use it when…" trigger vocabulary conventionally sits, so truncation removes precisely the part that governs invocation while leaving the skill visibly installed and apparently healthy. The skill simply stops being selected in cases it used to cover, with nothing anywhere reporting why. Two consequences follow:

1. **Front-load the triggers.** The earliest words must carry the conditions under which the skill applies, so that any truncation removes elaboration rather than meaning.
2. **Prefer trigger coverage to elegance.** Within the budget, spend characters on the vocabulary a request is likely to use, not on describing the mechanism. The mechanism is what the body is for.

**Known limitation.** The frontmatter `description` is metadata consulted to decide whether a skill is *relevant*, which is not the same as an instruction that is reliably *executed*. A conversation in which the skill's start-of-conversation directive was present in the description but `memory_start_conversation` was nonetheless never called has been observed. Shortening the description neither causes nor cures this; the reliability of start-of-conversation initialization is tracked separately as an open question ([Chapter 11](stateful-agent-design-chapter11.md#11-open-questions)) and is out of scope for this section, which governs only the field's length and content.

### 5.8 Bootstrapping via an Unconditionally-Loaded Channel

[Section 5.7](#57-frontmatter-constraints-and-portability) established that the skill `description` is metadata used to decide whether a skill is *relevant*, not a mechanism that guarantees an instruction is *executed* — and OQ#18 ([Chapter 11](stateful-agent-design-chapter11.md#111-remaining-open-questions)) records a real conversation in which the description was present in the skill listing and `memory_start_conversation` was nonetheless never called. Relying on the description alone to make the agent bootstrap memory is therefore unreliable by construction: the directive that governs the single most important action in the whole system — the mandatory first call that loads `core.md` and the block index — lives in a field whose job is discovery, and it is only elaborated in the skill body once the skill has already been judged relevant.

**The resolution is to place the bootstrap directive additionally in a channel that is loaded verbatim into every conversation, with no relevance gating.** This does not replace the skill: the skill's conversation-start protocol ([Section 5.3](#53-conversation-lifecycle)) and its description remain exactly as specified, the description continuing to do the discovery job it does well. What changes is that *execution reliability no longer depends on relevance matching* — the unconditional channel carries the imperative, and the skill carries the detail. The two reinforce each other; the belt does not need the suspenders to be present, but both cost little and the failure mode being guarded against is silent.

Each client has such a channel:

- **Claude Desktop:** the user's preferences (Settings → Profile personalization), which are loaded into every conversation. The wording below belongs there. (This is the same mechanism that already reliably steers other cross-conversation behavior in this deployment, such as the GitHub and Bluesky conventions.)
- **Claude Code:** the auto-loaded `CLAUDE.md`. The wording, and an important sub-agent-safety caveat, are given in [Section 6.5](stateful-agent-design-chapter6.md#65-claudemd-recommendations).

**Proposed Claude Desktop user-preferences wording:**

> At the start of every conversation, before doing anything else, call `memory_start_conversation` to load my stored memory. It returns a handle together with my core memory and the block index; use that handle on every subsequent memory tool call. If any memory tool reports an unknown or invalid handle, call `memory_start_conversation` again to obtain a fresh handle and retry. This is the only way to mint a handle — there is no other initialization path.

The final sentence is deliberate: it reflects the reaffirmed decision ([Chapter 3, Sections 3.3/3.14](stateful-agent-design-chapter3.md#314-handle-management)) that `memory_start_conversation` is the *sole* handle-minting mechanism and that the bridge performs no auto-initialization. Stating that plainly in the channel the agent actually reads removes any temptation to expect a handle to appear by some other means, and it makes the uniform error-recovery procedure ("get a new handle, retry") the obvious response to any handle error.

**What this section does not do.** It does not weaken or bypass the mandatory-first-call invariant; it strengthens the odds that the invariant is honored by putting the instruction where it will be read every time. And it does not make initialization automatic — an agent that ignores both the unconditional channel and the skill still fails to bootstrap, and that residual case is exactly what OQ#18 leaves open pending measurement (see [Chapter 8, Section 8.2.8](stateful-agent-design-chapter8.md#828-compliance-monitoring-script)).
