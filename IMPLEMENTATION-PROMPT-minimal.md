# Claude Code Prompt — Minimal `mcp-bridge` Implementation

## 0. Environment and ground rules (read first)

You are running in an isolated cloud VM that is already connected to the
**existing, empty, private** GitHub repo `fpl9000/mcp-bridge`. Note the following:

- **The repo already exists.** Do **not** create it, and do **not** push
  directly to `main`. Do your work on a branch and, once the Section 8 gate
  passes, open a **pull request** against `main`. Authentication is handled for
  you by the environment's git proxy — never place a token in any file or commit.
- **The design spec is already in this repo** at `docs/design-spec/` (a working
  copy of the `fpl9000/ai-skills` design docs). Read those files in place. They
  are **reference only**: do not modify them, and do not treat them as part of
  the deliverable.
- **Pre-staged files you must leave in place** (they are not your deliverables):
  `docs/design-spec/`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT-minimal.md` (this file), and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Files you are creating** (the deliverable): the Go sources listed in
  Section 3, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `bridge-config.yaml`, the project `README.md`,
  and `skill/SKILL.md`.
- **Network:** the Go toolchain must be able to fetch modules, so the sandbox's
  network allowlist must permit `proxy.golang.org`, `sum.golang.org`, and
  `github.com`. If `go mod download` fails with a network error, that allowlist
  is the cause — stop and report it rather than vendoring around it.

Build the **minimal first cut** of the MCP Bridge Server for my Stateful Agent System: the memory subsystem only. No sub-agent spawning, no local command execution, no maintenance/merging, and no branching. The goal is a working, tested, single-binary MCP server that gives Claude Desktop persistent Layer 2 memory through a small family of memory-aware tools.

My general conventions — commenting style, source formatting, and so on — are in `CLAUDE.md` at the root of this repo. Follow them. That file is a faithful **extract** of my authoritative global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, limited to the conventions that apply in this cloud VM (the Windows/Cygwin-local rules were omitted as inapplicable here). In particular, write thoroughly-commented code per the comment rules there: complete-sentence comments on the line *above* the code, explaining rationale rather than restating the code, and **no** comments on trivial lines such as imports. This prompt only states the things that are *specific to this task* and the decisions I've already made about scope.

---

## 1. Authoritative specification

The complete, authoritative design is staged in this repo at `docs/design-spec/` (a read-only working copy of the `fpl9000/ai-skills` design docs; the canonical source remains that repo). The main document is `stateful-agent-design.md`; the chapter files present are `stateful-agent-design-chapter3.md` through `...-chapter12.md` (there is no chapter 10 file — that is expected, not a missing copy). Ignore chapter 9 in `stateful-agent-design-chapter9.md` because it describes future enhancements unrelated to this task.

**Important:** the design document describes the *full* twelve-tool system. You are building a deliberate **subset** of it. Where the document describes spawning, `run_command`, maintenance, merging, or branching, read it for context but do **not** implement it. The scope table in Section 3 below is the contract — when the design document and this prompt disagree about *what to build*, this prompt wins; when they disagree about *how a thing in scope behaves*, the document wins.

Sections you must read closely (all in `chapter3` unless noted):

- Main doc §1–§2 — overview, architecture, terminology, data flows.
- §3.1 — Go module structure (I've pruned the file list for you in Section 4 below).
- §3.2 — configuration schema and loading (with my modifications in Section 5 below).
- §3.3, §3.7 — tool summary and the memory-tool abstraction/handle protocol.
- §3.8–§3.12 — the eight in-scope tool handlers.
- §3.14 — handle management (minting, handle map, read baselines, retention).
- §3.16 — block file format and atomic writes.
- §3.18 — bridge state persistence and recovery.
- §3.19 — error response convention.
- §3.22 — logging. §3.23 — error handling. §3.24 — graceful shutdown.
- Chapter 4 §4.3–§4.8 — file formats: `core.md`, derived index, blocks, episodic logs, decisions, naming conventions.
- Chapter 8 §8.1 — the bridge unit tests (in-scope subset listed in Section 7 below).
- Chapter 12 — the `mark3labs/mcp-go` SDK reference. Use this SDK for the MCP layer;
  do not hand-roll the protocol.

Sections to read only for context and then **skip implementing**: §3.4–§3.6 (`spawn_agent`, `check_agent`, `run_command`), §3.13 (maintenance), §3.15 (branching), §3.17 (merge), §3.20 (async executor), §3.21 (job lifecycle).

---

## 2. The two scope-narrowing decisions I've already made

These differ from the design document, so apply them everywhere:

1. **No branching at all.** The full design resolves a concurrent read-modify-write race by transparently routing the losing write to a per-handle *branch* of the block. We are **not** building that in this cut. Instead, the write mutex serializes all memory I/O and the **last writer to a block wins**. This means the entire branching subsystem is omitted: no branch files, no branch naming, no branch routing, no branch map in the persisted state, no lazy-adoption disk scan, no immediate-checkpoint-on-branch. (The `changed_since_last_read` read-time flag still exists and is the LLM's only concurrency signal — see Section 6.)

2. **Use `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`** for parsing and composing block YAML frontmatter. It is pure Go and CGO-free, so it does not compromise the single-static-binary goal. It is the one dependency beyond the MCP SDK.

## 3. Scope table — exactly what to build

**Tools to implement (8):**

| Tool                        | Behavior reference                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory_start_conversation` | §3.8 — mint an 8-char opaque handle; return `{ handle, core, index }` in one round trip                                                         |
| `memory_get_core`           | §3.9 — return `core.md` content; set read baseline; report `changed_since_last_read`                                                            |
| `memory_write_core`         | §3.9 — replace `core.md` atomically; **no** frontmatter on core; last-writer-wins                                                               |
| `memory_get_index`          | §3.10 — derive the index from block frontmatter on demand (per-handle cache); no stored index file                                              |
| `memory_get_block`          | §3.11 — return block body with frontmatter stripped; set baseline; report `changed_since_last_read`                                             |
| `memory_write_block`        | §3.11 — replace block body; manage `summary`/`updated_at` frontmatter; create block if absent (summary required for creation); last-writer-wins |
| `memory_append_block`       | §3.11 — append to an existing block under the mutex; never creates a block (`BLOCK_NOT_FOUND` if absent)                                        |
| `memory_append_episodic`    | §3.12 — append a timestamped entry to `blocks/episodic-YYYY-MM.md`; handle month rotation; auto-create the monthly file with frontmatter        |

Every memory tool takes `handle` as its first required parameter and echoes it back in every response, success or failure (§3.7).

**Tools to OMIT (4):** `memory_run_maintenance`, `spawn_agent`, `check_agent`, `run_command`.

**Source files to build** (from the §3.1 layout, pruned): `main.go`, `config.go`, `tools.go`, `handles.go`, `memory_core.go`, `memory_index.go`, `memory_block.go`, `memory_episodic.go`, `frontmatter.go`, `persistence.go`, `memmutex.go`, `errors.go`, `logging.go`, plus `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `bridge-config.yaml`.

**Source files to OMIT:** `branching.go`, `async.go`, `spawn.go`, `check.go`, `run_command.go`, `maintenance.go`, `jobs.go`.

---

## 4. Repository and module

- Module path: `github.com/fpl9000/mcp-bridge`.
- The repo `fpl9000/mcp-bridge` **already exists and this session is working in it.** Do not create it. Put the code at the repo root (the module root). After the Section 8 gate passes, commit the grouped commits on a working branch and **open a pull request against `main`** — do not push to `main` directly. Authentication is handled by the environment's git proxy; do not embed any token anywhere.
- Pure Go, no CGO, no external C libraries — must cross-compile to a single static `mcp-bridge.exe` for Windows (`GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64`), which is the shippable target since Claude Desktop runs on Windows.
- Provide a `--version` flag (used in the build smoke test) and a short `README.md` covering build, configuration, and how Claude Desktop launches the binary.

---

## 5. Configuration (`config.go` + `bridge-config.yaml`)

Follow §3.2 for config-file location resolution (`--config` flag, then `MCP_BRIDGE_CONFIG` env var, then the default path). Apply these task-specific rules:

- **Parse the full §3.2 schema** so the config file never has to change when the deferred features land later. Define struct fields for every section (`async`, `sub_agent`, `run_command`, `memory`, `handle`, `persistence`, `branching`, `maintenance`, `logging`, `claude_cli`). The deferred-feature sections parse and then sit unused — do not act on them.
- **Validate only the in-scope subset.** Require and validate `memory.*`, `handle.*`, `persistence.*`, and `logging.*`. Do **not** validate the executability of `claude_cli.path` or `run_command.shell`, and do not enforce `async.sync_window_seconds < 30` — those guard features this build doesn't contain, and enforcing them would stop the bridge from starting for no reason.
- Create `memory.directory` and its `blocks/` subdirectory if they don't exist (the §3.2 validator already calls for creating the memory directory).
- Ship a default `bridge-config.yaml` in the repo containing the full schema, with `branching.enabled: false` and a comment on each deferred section noting it is not yet honored by this build. It's acceptable to `go:embed` this default and write it out / fall back to it when no external config file is present.
- Because branching is omitted, if the loaded config sets `branching.enabled: true`, **log a warning** at startup ("branching not implemented in this build; last-writer-wins in effect") rather than silently implying behavior that isn't there.

---

## 6. Cross-cutting requirements that are easy to get wrong

- **Never log to stdout.** The bridge speaks MCP/JSON-RPC over stdout; logging there corrupts the protocol stream. Log to the file configured in `logging.*` (stderr is an acceptable secondary). This is `logging.go`, per §3.22.
- **Atomic writes everywhere** memory is modified: write to a temp file in the same directory, then rename over the target, so a reader never sees a partial file and a failed write leaves no corruption (§3.16). On write failure, clean up the temp file and return `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- **Frontmatter is bridge-private** (§3.16). Block bodies returned to the LLM never contain the `---` frontmatter header; block content the LLM supplies is stored verbatim in the body even if it itself begins with `---`. `core.md` has no frontmatter.
- **Cold-start tolerance.** An empty store is normal and must not error: `memory_start_conversation` against a missing `core.md` and empty `blocks/` returns an empty `core` string and an empty `index` array (tested in §8.1.1).
- **Handles, baselines, and the change flag** (`handles.go`, §3.14): mint opaque lowercase-alphanumeric handles of `handle.id_length`; track per-handle read baselines (ModTime + size) recorded on every read; on a read, set `changed_since_last_read` by comparing the block's current signature against this handle's last baseline for that block. With branching gone, this flag is the *only* concurrency signal the LLM gets — the SKILL.md "stale content" guidance relies on it. Note that handle *eviction* runs only during the (deferred) maintenance sweep, so in this build handles are minted and tracked but never evicted — that's expected and fine.
- **Writes are unconditional last-writer-wins.** Write handlers proceed straight to the atomic base-block write under the mutex; there is no race-routing. You may optionally log at `info` when a write's baseline indicates it is overwriting a block that changed since this handle last read it, purely as a diagnostic.
- **Memory mutex** (`memmutex.go`): a single `sync.Mutex` serializing all memory file I/O so concurrent tool calls never interleave or corrupt a file. (Ignore the "merge mutex semantics" mentioned in §3.1 — that belongs to the deferred maintenance feature.)
- **State persistence** (`persistence.go`, §3.18): persist live handles, their read baselines, and last-activity to `.bridge-state.json` (no branch maps — they're always empty now). Debounced checkpoints per `persistence.checkpoint_interval_seconds`; atomic state writes (temp + rename); load-and-reconcile at startup; a corrupt or truncated state file logs a warning and starts clean (no lazy-adoption fallback, since that was branch-file recovery).
- **Graceful shutdown** (§3.24, the relevant half): on stdin EOF / shutdown, flush a final state checkpoint before exiting. There are no subprocesses to kill in this build.
- **Error convention** (`errors.go`, §3.19): responses are `{ handle, ok: false, error: { code, message [, context] } }`. The reachable code set in this build is `INVALID_HANDLE`, `MALFORMED_HANDLE`, `BLOCK_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_BLOCK_NAME`, `SUMMARY_REQUIRED`, `SUMMARY_TOO_LONG`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` (omit `MAINTENANCE_IN_PROGRESS` — its feature is deferred). Block *names*, never paths, are the only memory addresses: reject names containing path separators or `..` with `INVALID_BLOCK_NAME`. No error message may leak filesystem paths, the mutex, or frontmatter internals.
- **MCP layer** (`tools.go` + `main.go`): register exactly the **8** tools over the stdio transport using `mark3labs/mcp-go`; implement the `initialize`/capabilities handshake; declare each tool's input schema (handle required on all eight).

---

## 7. Tests (`go test ./...`, §8.1 subset)

Standard Go tests, each using its own temporary memory directory. Implement the
in-scope §8.1 sections, dropping the rows that assert branching/maintenance behavior:

- §8.1.1 — `memory_start_conversation` (uniqueness, format, empty store, state checkpoint on creation, handle survives a compaction round-trip).
- §8.1.2 — `memory_get_core` / `memory_get_block` (frontmatter stripped on read, baseline recorded, the `changed_since_last_read` first/unchanged/changed cases, read-your-own-writes, bad-name and bad-handle errors, handle echo). **Omit** the "Branched read routing" row.
- §8.1.3 — `memory_write_core` / `memory_write_block` (new-block-with-frontmatter, summary required/too-long, update with/without summary, core has no frontmatter, atomic replacement, temp-file cleanup on failure, frontmatter-private body).
- §8.1.4 — `memory_append_block` / `memory_append_episodic` (append to existing, `BLOCK_NOT_FOUND` on missing, empty-text no-op, monthly file creation, month rotation, timestamping, episodic indexed and readable as a block). **Omit** the "append routes to existing branch" row.
- §8.1.5 — derived index (empty dir, matches frontmatter, sorted by name, extended ISO 8601 timestamps, no index file on disk, `.bridge-state.json` excluded, missing frontmatter tolerated, per-handle cache invalidated on write). **Omit** the "index reflects own branch" row.
- §8.1.8 — state persistence (written at shutdown, debounced checkpoint, atomic write, load-and-reconcile at startup, corrupt file → clean start with warning). **Omit** the branch-file and lazy-adoption rows.
- §8.1.9 — write-mutex serialization (concurrent writes don't interleave; write + append on different blocks both serialize; no deadlock under rapid mixed ops; index derivation sees a consistent point-in-time view).
- §8.1.10 — error-response convention (shape, code set above, no abstraction leaks, uniform `INVALID_HANDLE` recovery).
- §8.1.15 — MCP integration (initialize handshake returns capabilities and the 8-tool list; missing-required-param and missing-handle errors; two concurrent calls over a pipe both complete).

**Omit entirely:** §8.1.6 (branching), §8.1.7 (maintenance), §8.1.11–§8.1.14 (spawn/check/run_command/jobs). The §8.2 skill tests and §8.4 integration tests are manual procedures I'll run later against Claude Desktop — do not attempt them here.

---

## 8. Commits and the acceptance gate

**Commit in a handful of logically grouped commits**, not one big blob and not noisy "wip" history — group along the architectural seams so I can review the build chunk by chunk. A reasonable grouping (use your judgment):

1. Module scaffold + config loading/validation + logging.
2. Handle management + state persistence.
3. Frontmatter + block file format + atomic writes (the memory mutex).
4. Memory tools: core + index.
5. Memory tools: block + episodic.
6. MCP server wiring (tool registration, stdio, handshake) + `main` entry point + README.
7. Test suite.

The **final** state must build and pass; intermediate commits need not each be green.

**Before opening the pull request, this four-part gate must pass:**

1. The build succeeds and `--version` runs. Because this VM is Linux, do this in two parts: (a) build a **native** binary for the smoke test — `go build -o mcp-bridge .` — and confirm `./mcp-bridge --version` runs; and (b) confirm the **Windows** artifact cross-compiles cleanly — `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-bridge.exe .` — which is the real deliverable target. (You can't execute the `.exe` on Linux; a clean cross-compile plus the native `--version` run together satisfy the smoke test. Since the code is pure Go with CGO off, both must build.)
2. `go vet ./...` is clean. (Pay attention to `copylocks` — the memory mutex must be passed by pointer, never copied by value.)
3. `gofmt -l .` reports no files.
4. `go test ./...` passes.

Only once all four pass: finalize your grouped commits on the working branch and open a pull request against `main`. Do not push to `main` directly, and do not attempt to create the repo (it already exists). Leave a clear PR description summarizing the grouped commits so I can review the build chunk by chunk.

---

## 9. Secondary task: the memory SKILL.md (separate, ungated deliverable)

After the bridge is done, produce the memory skill's `SKILL.md` from the content in Chapter 5 §5.2, with these adjustments for the reduced scope:

- **Remove the "Memory Maintenance" section** and any other references to `memory_run_maintenance` (e.g., in the lifecycle and error-handling sections) — that tool does not exist in this build, and the skill must not instruct Claude to call it.
- The skill must reference **only the eight implemented tools**.
- Keep everything else: the memory model, handle protocol, conversation-start protocol, read/write/append triggers, stale-content guidance (which leans on `changed_since_last_read`), block-creation rules, and the `INVALID_HANDLE` re-init-and-retry recovery protocol.

Write it to `skill/SKILL.md` in the `mcp-bridge` repo (I'll relocate and zip it per §7.6 myself). The four-part gate above applies to the Go bridge only, not to this file.

---

## 10. Explicitly out of scope for this task

Do not build, and do not ask to build: sub-agent spawning, `run_command`, maintenance, merging, branching, the async executor, or the job manager. Do **not** create or seed `core.md` — I'm handling the initial memory seed separately with accurate content. The bridge's only obligation toward `core.md` is to tolerate its absence gracefully (cold start) and to read/write it when the tools are called.
